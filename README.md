this code is an embodiment of curiosity and starting something new. A kind of interest. 
I was interested in what the method of binary array search is all about. 
It is a rather trivial aspect of programming, but as a start, it is a good example of correct, optimized code. 
And so an imitation of good and standard - rigorous logic and thinking for the industry. 
There is a lot of Russian in the code, I will fix it later. 
Well so you can familiarize yourself. I don't mind comments, I'm glad to criticize, or maybe you can add something and teach something ?
